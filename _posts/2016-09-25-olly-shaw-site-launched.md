I've got a talk lined up at the meetup I co-organise [DevOps North East](http://www.meetup.com/DevOpsNorthEast). We've been going a year now and this is billed as a back to school talk. I want to present something cool and easy to follow as a means of introducing Docker. So the first few pages of this blog will be a guide about how I put the whole Docker demo together.

I've put this blog page together with the advice from [JONATHAN MCGLONE] (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Cheers Jonathan, I hope someone finds my blocg as useful as I've found yours!
